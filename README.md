## About Lexus

Lexus is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota. Launched in 1989, Lexus has established itself as a leading global luxury automotive brand known for its pursuit of perfection, exceptional quality, and innovative technology.

## Generations

### Early Development (1983-1989)

The concept of Lexus began in 1983 with Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda's challenge to create the world's best luxury car. This led to the F1 project (Flagship One), a secret initiative that involved hundreds of engineers, designers, and other specialists working to develop a vehicle that could compete with the best luxury brands in the world. The project culminated in the introduction of the Lexus LS 400, which made its debut at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 1989.

### Establishment and Growth (1989-1999)

Lexus launched as Toyota's luxury division in 1989, initially in the United States, with the LS 400 sedan. The brand quickly gained recognition for exceptional build quality, smooth performance, and value compared to established European competitors. During this period, Lexus expanded its lineup with the introduction of the ES 250 sedan, the SC coupe, and the brand's first SUV, the LX 450. By the end of this era, Lexus had established itself as the top-selling luxury import brand in the United States.

### Global Expansion (2000-2009)

In the early 2000s, Lexus began expanding globally as an independent brand division, launching in markets such as Europe, China, and other parts of Asia. This period saw the introduction of hybrid technology with the RX 400h, the world's first luxury hybrid SUV. The brand also introduced the IS sports sedan, aimed at younger buyers, and continued to refine its flagship LS series. Lexus established its F performance division during this time, launching the IS F in 2007 and the exclusive LFA supercar project.

### Modern Era (2010-Present)

The modern era has seen Lexus embrace a more distinctive design language, starting with the adoption of the signature "spindle grille" and more aggressive styling. Lexus has expanded its hybrid lineup significantly, with hybrid variants available across most of its model range. The brand has also ventured into the compact luxury crossover segment with the NX and UX models. In recent years, Lexus has been investing heavily in electric vehicle technology, autonomous driving features, and connectivity, while maintaining its reputation for quality and reliability. The introduction of the all-electric RZ in 2023 marked an important step in the brand's electrification strategy.
